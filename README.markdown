# What is it?

A little script to quickly add virtual hosts to your local Apache configuration for development purposes on Mac OS X.

Given a name like "example.site" and a path to the files for the site root directory, it will make the site appear at http://example.site.

Currently it have been tested on Apache 2.4.23 and Mac OS Sierra.

## Installation

Make a directory to contain all the generated vhost config files:

```sh
sudo mkdir /etc/apache2/extra/vhosts
```

Add this line to your /etc/apache2/httpd.conf file:

```apache
Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/vhosts/*.conf
```

**Do not restart Apache on this step.**

Place the `vhostman.rb` to somewhere, for instance, somewhere in your home dir and add alias for this into your `.bash_profile`, like:

```sh
alias vhostman="sudo $HOME/somewhere/vhostman.rb"
```

Ensure it's executable:

```sh
chmod 777 $HOME/somewhere/vhostman.rb
```

**If you want to enable Server Side Includes (SSI), you must edit the ```httpd.conf``` file and uncomment the includes module. It looks like this:**

```apache
LoadModule include_module libexec/apache2/mod_include.so
```

That's it, now you can start to use it.

## Usage

Create folder for your domain in your or *Code* directory (`$HOME/Code`), for instance: *example* (for real, it doesn't matter how you'll name it)

```sh
mkdir $HOME/Code/example
```

Next open Terminal and do like this to add `example.site` (it's what you will type in your browser):

```sh
vhostman add example.site --webroot=$HOME/Code/example
```

Apache will be restarted and virtual host config will be applied to get it work.

Thatâ€™s it! You can view your site in browser: http://example.site.

### Editing an Existing Site
You can change the host name, webroot, or both with the following usage:

```sh
vhostman edit example.site --new=testing.site --webroot=$HOME/Code/testing
```

At least one of the ```--new``` and ```--webroot``` options must be used.

### Removing an Existing Site
Removing an existing site is easy, all you need is the site host name and it will remove the reference in your host file as well as the configuration file.

```sh
vhostman remove example.site
```

### Fixing issues

If you get an error like that:

    bad interpreter: Operation not permitted

Then do this:
```sh
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine vhostman.rb
```
